\chapter*{Abstract}

The present thesis lays out the design and implementation of a laboratory experiment evaluating the interplay of taxation, income inequality and the Prospect of Upward Mobility. I find that, consistent with previous research, people over-invest when participating in a rent-seeking contest. However, in my design, investments over the optimum decrease over time in all treatments. Interestingly, this effect appears to be more pronounced in groups where a taxation and redistribution scheme has been implemented.
The main driver of this effect appears to be an income effect created trough the more equally redistributed income.\\
