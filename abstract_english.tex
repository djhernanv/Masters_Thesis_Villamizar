\chapter*{Abstract}

The present thesis lays out the design and implementation of a laboratory experiment evaluating the interplay of inequality, productivity and effort provision in a competitive setting. The design takes the form of a repeated Tullock contest where participants decide how much to work and can invest part of their earnings to increase their chances of obtaining a piece rate income above average in the next period.\\

I find that, consistent with previous research, people over-invest when participating in a rent-seeking contest. However, in my experiment, investments over the optimum decrease over time in all treatments. Against my expectations, this effect appears to be more pronounced in groups where a taxation and redistribution scheme has been implemented, in part because those groups invested nominally and relatively more than the control groups. The main driver of this effect appears to be an income effect created trough the more equally redistributed income and as a result of a fixed share of available income heuristic.\\

Probabilities of Upward Mobility grew apart with each passing round, with more participants having probabilities at each end of the distribution. The probability to win itself was determined exclusively by the available income and not, as expected, by the wage or winning status. Further cementing the idea that participants chose their investment as a share of their available income and not of their valuation of the contest.\\
