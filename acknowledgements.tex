\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

 I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Jean-Robert Tyran for not only providing the financial support for this thesis, but also for awakening in me an interest in behavioural and experimental economics. To Dr. Axel Sonntag, who also suggested the topic for this work: thank you for providing hands-on support and for allowing open discussion throughout the entire process. Thank you also for your comprehensive feedback and for making sure the final result is the best possible version.\\

Without Milena Damrau’s help, none of the small steps needed to submit the thesis would have been possible. Thank you for your tireless moral and conceptual support throughout the duration of my Master’s studies. David Zenz has been my go-to person in all statistical issues on and off campus and this thesis has only profited from his expertise. Dr. Anja Rösner: thank you for always encouraging me and for keeping me motivated during my studies.\\

I am grateful to my family, especially my mother, Ivonne Maldonado, as well to the participants of the pilot sessions: Andres Pena, Dr. Michele Bevilacqua, and Marcela Torres.
